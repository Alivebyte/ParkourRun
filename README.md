# Parkour Run

Simple tile-based platform-like game, where you play as a runner. Your task is to complete the level.

Unfortunately, due to time restrictions and personal issues, a lot of features aren't, such as player animations, decal flipping, actual game timer, enemies, etc...

How to play:

Use A and D keys to run forward and backwards
Space key to jump

When you stand near the wall, you can climb by holding W key

As again, due to time restrictions and lack of skills the game has lots of bugs and *ISN'T* fairly optimized.

P.S Pls, don't look up the code
